# CyberSecurity Tasks

This repository contains the tasks I completed as part of the **Intern Intelligence** program. Below are the descriptions and details of the two tasks I performed: Penetration Testing and Malware Analysis.

## Task 1: Penetration Testing - SMOL Lab (TryHackMe)

In this task, I worked on a penetration testing exercise using the SMOL lab on **TryHackMe**. The objective was to identify vulnerabilities and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the target system.

- **Platform Used**: TryHackMe
- **Lab Name**: SMOL Lab
- **Tools Used**: 
  - Nmap
  - Burp Suite
  - Hydra
  - Netcat
  - Metasploit (optional)
- **Key Objectives**:
  - Scanning for open ports
  - Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities
  - Gaining shell access
  - Post-exploitation activities
  - Privilege escalation

### Summary:
The lab involved various steps, including enumeration, vulnerability analysis, and exploiting weak services to escalate privileges. The final goal was to gain root access to the target machine and retrieve the flag.

## Task 2: Malware Analysis

In this task, I focused on malware analysis to understand the behavior and functionality of a piece of malicious software. The goal was to analyze the malware sample and identify how it operates and the techniques it uses.

- **Tools Used**:
  - Static Analysis: IDA Pro, Ghidra
  - Dynamic Analysis: Cuckoo Sandbox, Process Monitor
  - Network Traffic Analysis: Wireshark, TCPDump
  - Reverse Engineering: OllyDbg, x64dbg

### Summary:
The task involved both static and dynamic analysis. Static analysis was used to examine the malware code, while dynamic analysis involved executing the malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior. Key findings included identifying the malware's network communication patterns, system modifications, and persistence techniques.

## Conclusion

These tasks provided valuable experience in both penetration testing and malware analysis. By completing these exercises, I gained hands-on skills in real-world cybersecurity scenarios, improving my ability to identify, exploit, and analyze security threats.
